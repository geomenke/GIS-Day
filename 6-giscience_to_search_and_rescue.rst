* What is a Park Ranger?

  * Protect the park from the people, the people from the park & protect the
    people from each other.
  * 300 arrests a year

* What is Search & Rescue?

  * Locate
  * Stabilize
  * Extract
  * Prevention?
  * "Actions occur at a time & place."

* Framework

  * If SAR is a inherently spatial process, then GIS should apply.

* GIScience Topics

  * Probabilistic time geo
  * Dynamic GIS
  * Geo one-class data
  * Data quality, spatial uncertainty & innovative uses

* Yosemite

  * 12k sq. miles
  * 95% wilderness
  * 4M annual visitors (3.5M don't leave pavement)
  * How to find & rescue them?
  * Where & when do they get rescued?

* Locate

  * When location is known:
  
    * In person
    * Radio
    * Cellphone (enhanced 911)
    * S.E.N.D. (SPOT) - satelite
  
  * When location is unknown:
  
    * Point Last Seen
    * Last Known Point
    * Witnesses
    * Itinerary
    * Clues

* Searches

  * PLS Search
  * Hasty Search - Trail blocks
  * Planning
  
    * Probability of Area
    * Probability of Detection
    * Struggle between large enough search area & high enough potential to find them
  
* Lost Person Bahvior Statistics
* ISRID Data - statistical POA

  * Gives an idea of search area

* Travel cost model

  * How far the person can travel
  * Not used enough

* Incident Archive

  * Cross-referenced against historic data

* Assignments

  * Search Segments
  
    * Terrain
    * Man-made
    * Integrate aerial data

* Needs more automation & data integration
* Computer aided dispatch
* Use of Expert Models (95% accuracy)
* Machine Learning models (Maxent significant relationships) - Same as
  Expert model
* Preventative SAR

  * Visitors
  * Management
  * Rescuers

* Big problem - lacking spatially explicit information
* Need georeferencing - describing where/what things have happened

  * Put it on a map, do it well and know how confident you should be

* Probability-field method
* Spatio-temporal Distribution

  * Seasonal
  * Incidents involving helicopters
  * Incidents involving females vs. males (kernel density)

* Build a digital library of what has happened

  * Type of incident
  * Straight location
  * Temporally
