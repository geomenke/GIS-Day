* Outline

  * Walk through a wildlife corridor analysis
  * Other wildlife connectivity efforts
  * Adventures of a solo GIS consultant

* Why?

  * Wildlife habitat fragmentation
  * Patch isolation
  * Island Biogeography
  * Conservation biologists have determined that connectivity is crucial to
    maintaining healthy wildlife populations

* Background

  * 2003 - NM is ahead of the game
  * Critical Mass Workshop - ID's animal-vehicle collision hotspots
  * House Joint Memorial
  * Map of hotspots

* 2003-2007 Tijeras Canyon Safe Passage Coalition

  * Huge decrease in collisions
  * 2008 - NM is falling behind neighboring states
  * Data gap - insufficient data elsewhere in the state
  * Need statewide assessment
  * BEV awarded grant to model cougar corridors

* Methodology

  * http://corridordesign.org/ + ArcGIS 9.2
  * Designed by Northern Arizona U.

* Corridor Design

  * Inversely proportional relationship between habitat suitability &
    resistance to movement
  * Requires a habitat suitability model
  * Identify corridor termini
  * Where to model a corridor?
  
    * Combination of 2003 CMW, concentrations of carnivore roadkill data,
      cougar habitat patches & generation of overall permable landscape

* Deductive model

  * Based on literature review & expert opinion
  * Prey availability (40%)
  * Distance to roads (25%)
  * Human Pop (15%)
  * Terrain Ruggedness (15%)
  * Other

* Step 1 - Layer Prep
* Step 2 - Habitat Modeling
* Step 3 - Corridor Modeling
* Walkthrough of step 3
* Example Map
* Cost Distance Surface
* Least Cost Slices of Landscape
* Results

  * 26 corridors modeled
  * 15 crossed critical highway segements
  * 50% have sig. roadkill data

* Revisited the top four CSW areas to verify data
* Other Wildlife Connectivity Efforts

  * The Wildlands Network
    
    * Continental Mega-linkages
    * "Networks of people protecting networks of land"
    * Collecting data over 5K sq mile area
    * Reaffirms "islands"
    * Priority natural conservancies
    * Compare against current proposals to identify well-covered & gaps in
      coverage
  
  * The Wild LifeLines
  
    * Look at all connectivity over the entire lower 48 states
    * Based on NatureServe eco dataset
    * Draws on percolation & network theories ("Human avoidance network")
  
  * CircuitScape
  
    * http://circuitscape.org/
    * Open Source
    * Brad McRae
    * Models wildlife connectivity/gene flow based on electronic circuit theory
    * Tested well & promising
    * Analyzes "pinch points" in corridors

* Adventures of a Solo GIS Consultant

  * Why?
  * Focus on using tech to solve world's mounting social & ecological problems
  * Want freedom to choose what project to take on

* Bird's Eye View

  * http://birdseyeviewgis.com/
  * Sole proprietorship
  * Albuquerque, NM
  * Focus on non-profits
  * Ten years running
  * Built on the side

* Services

  * Cartography
  * Spatial analysis
  * Data mining/creation/conversion
  * Instruction
  * FOSS web mapping

* Keys to Success

  * Have a solid niche
  * Provide services to conservation
  * FOSS GIS
  * Stay involved in the community
    
    * NM Geographic Info Council
    * Society for Conservation GIS
    * Grand Canyon Wildlands Council
    * Teaching
  
  * Speaking
  * Social Media (experimental for him)

* Keeping current

  * Especially FOSS
  * Conferences are a slippery slope (not making money)
  * Teaching
  * Twitter - @thegisforum
  * iPhone Apps
  
    * Trailguru
    * Trails
    * Elevation Pro
    * earthscape
    * Google Earth
    * Layar
    * GISRaom
    * iMapRadar
    * openmaps

* Multitasking between lots of small projects

  * Diversity in projects
